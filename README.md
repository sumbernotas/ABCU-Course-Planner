# ABCU-Course-Planner
This is a console based program created for my Data Structures and Algorithms class at SNHU. It implements a binary tree to store each course that is listed in the .txt file and uses a BST concepts alongside the use of classes and vectors to properly read a file, store, search, and find data. 

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem being solved was that an advising team needed a way to easily search and pull from a list of courses. This program allowed for easier registration as well as adding and deleting courses in that list

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I first created pseudocode to visually plan out how the project would look. I implemented three different systems, a binary tree, hash table, and vector, into the pseudocode to see how each one went with the program. I then created a runtime analysis to see which of those systems would work best and fastest for the program which in my case was a vector. Data structures are extremely important to understand and consider when creating a program because it can drastically change how a program functions as well as how fast it can function.
