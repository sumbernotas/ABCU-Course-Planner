# ABCU-Course-Planner
This is a console based program created for my Data Structures and Algorithms class at SNHU. It implements a binary tree to store each course that is listed in the .txt file and uses a BST concepts alongside the use of classes and vectors to properly read a file, store, search, and find data. 

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem being solved was that an advising team needed a way to easily search and pull from a list of courses. This program allowed for easier registration as well as adding and deleting courses in that list

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I first created pseudocode to visually plan out how the project would look. I implemented three different systems, a binary tree, hash table, and vector, into the pseudocode to see how each one went with the program. I then created a runtime analysis to see which of those systems would work best and fastest for the program which in my case was a vector. Data structures are extremely important to understand and consider when creating a program because it can drastically change how a program functions as well as how fast it can function. 

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Any roadblocks that I encountered were solved by doing more research into the topic I was struggling with. Any error, complication, or just shear confusion on a part of the code, lead me to look back over my coursework and Zybooks material as well as look through stack overflow and reddit thnreads. This helped me get my code running with no error! 

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has definitely impacted my mindset when creating a program moving forward. It is important to think about all aspects of the program and how it is actually running behind the scenes. It is also important to think about what way is the best way to solve a problem for my specific needs. Going forward, I will implement what I learned in DSA to better my programs 

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Before this course, I knew only the very basics of the impact data structures had on programs. Now that I've completed this course, I am safe the say that it will be a major aspect of how my code in the future will be more readable, maintainable, and adaptable. Doing this project made me think of problems in a different way and understand that there is more than one solution. Analyzing each solution to see which is best for my problem and implementing it into code to not only make sense but function properly, takes a lot of trial and error as well as practice creating readable code. I needed to understand what I was doing if I had to take a day or so away from the code. This project immensely allowed me to better my programs to be understandable to myself, others, and able to adapt to those changes when needed.
