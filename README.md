# ABCU-Course-Planner
This is a console based program created for my Data Structures and Algorithms class at SNHU. It implements a binary tree to store each course that is listed in the .txt file and uses a BST concepts alongside the use of classes and vectors to properly read a file, store, search, and find data.
